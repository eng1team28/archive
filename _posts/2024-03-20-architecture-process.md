WEEK3 
The first set of CRC cards were created to follow the requirements

Some CRC cards we collaborated on in a meeting show how our requirements relate to responsibilities

The CRC cards were subsequently rearranged and simplified to make the next stage easier

The relation between classes was defined, allowing for the class model to be created

The UML draft becomes more refined as the architecture and implementation inform each other
